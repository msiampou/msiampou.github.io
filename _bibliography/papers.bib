  abstract = {Accurately modeling and analyzing time series data is crucial for downstream applications across various fields, including healthcare, finance, astronomy, and epidemiology. However, real-world time series often exhibit irregularities such as misaligned timestamps, missing entries, and variable sampling rates, complicating their analysis. Existing approaches often rely on imputation, which can introduce biases. A few approaches that directly model irregularity tend to focus exclusively on either capturing intra-series patterns or inter-series relationships, missing the benefits of integrating both. To this end, we present WaveGNN, a novel framework designed to directly (i.e., no imputation) embed irregularly sampled multivariate time series data for accurate predictions. WaveGNN utilizes a Transformer-based encoder to capture intra-series patterns by directly encoding the temporal dynamics of each time series. To capture inter-series relationships, WaveGNN uses a dynamic graph neural network model, where each node represents a sensor, and the edges capture the long- and short-term relationships between them. Our experimental results on real-world healthcare datasets demonstrate that WaveGNN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, with an average relative improvement of 14.7% in F1-score when compared to the second-best baseline in cases with extreme sparsity. Our ablation studies reveal that both intra-series and inter-series modeling significantly contribute to this notable improvement.},

  abstract = {The abundance of vehicle trajectory data offers a new opportunity to 
              compute driving routes between origins and destinations. Current graph-based routing pipelines, 
              while effective, involve substantial costs in constructing, maintaining, and updating road network 
              graphs to reflect real-time conditions. In this study, we propose a new trajectory-based routing 
              paradigm that bypasses current workflows by directly utilizing raw trajectory data to compute 
              efficient routes. Our method, named TrajRoute, uniquely "follows" historical trajectories from 
              a source to a destination, constructing paths that reflect actual driver behavior and implicit 
              preferences. To supplement areas with sparse trajectory data, the road network is also incorporated 
              into TrajRoute's index, and tunable parameters are introduced to control the balance between road 
              segments and trajectories, ensuring a unified and adaptable routing approach. We experimentally verify 
              our approach by comparing it to an existing online routing service. Our results demonstrate that as the 
              number of trajectories covering the road network increases, TrajRoute produces increasingly accurate 
              travel time and route length estimates while gradually eliminating the need to downgrade to the road 
              network. This highlights the potential of simpler, data-driven pipelines for routing, offering 
              lower-maintenance alternatives to conventional systems.},

              as identifying the topological relationships between two different
              geospatial objects. However, existing encoding methods are limited as they are typically customized to handle only specific types
              of spatial data, which impedes their applicability across different
              downstream tasks where multiple data types coexist. To address
              this, we introduce Poly2Vec, an encoding framework that unifies
              the modeling of different geospatial objects, including 2D points,
              polylines, and polygons, irrespective of the downstream task. We
              leverage the power of the 2D Fourier transform to encode useful
              spatial properties, such as shape and location, from geospatial objects into fixed-length vectors. These vectors are then inputted into
              neural network models for spatial reasoning tasks. This unified approach eliminates the need to develop and train separate models for
              each distinct spatial type. We evaluate Poly2Vec on both synthetic
              and real datasets of mixed geometry types and verify its consistent
              performance across several downstream spatial reasoning tasks.},

  abstract={The inherent challenges in recruiting human subjects, particularly infants, often hinder the acquisition of sufficiently large datasets for health research, thereby limiting the
    applicability of conventional machine-learning (ML) approaches.
    In this study, we analyze full-day motion recordings from two
    groups: typically developing infants (N = 12) and infants at
    risk for developmental disabilities (N = 24), further divided
    into those with good (N = 10) and poor (N = 9) developmental
    outcomes at 24 months. The goal is to differentiate at-risk (AR)
    infants from those with typical development (TD) and predict
    outcomes for the at-risk category using wearable data. Due to its
    limited size, previous studies on this dataset, employing statistical
    and machine learning methods, raise reliability concerns. To
    address this, we introduce a novel algorithmic approach to extract
    meaningful patterns, referred to as Motifs, from the raw signals.
    The abundance of Motifs serves as highly informative indicators,
    enabling effective differentiation between the groups. Evaluation
    on this limited-size dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of
    Motifs in distinguishing AR from TD infants and predicting
    future outcomes for the at-risk category.},

    urban area is critical for planning and decision making in various application domains, from urban planning and transportation
    management to public health and social studies. Although this forecasting problem can be formulated as a multivariate time-series
    forecasting task, current approaches cannot fully exploit the everchanging multi-context correlations among POIs. Therefore, we
    propose Busyness Graph Neural Network (BysGNN), a temporal
    graph neural network designed to learn and uncover the underlying
    multi-context correlations between POIs for accurate visit forecasting. Unlike other approaches where only time-series data is used to
    learn a dynamic graph, BysGNN utilizes all contextual information
    and time-series data to learn an accurate dynamic graph representation. By incorporating all contextual, temporal, and spatial signals,
    we observe a significant improvement in our forecasting accuracy
    over state-of-the-art forecasting models in our experiments with

  abstract={Geospatial Interlinking constitutes a crucial data integration task
    that associates pairs of geometries with topological relations. Its
    high computational cost, though, scales poorly to voluminous datasets.
    Progressive methods were recently proposed to reduce this cost by
    sacrificing recall to an affordable extent. They operate in a learningfree manner that relies on mere heuristics, which can be conservative (i.e., retaining too many unrelated pairs) or aggressive (i.e.,
    discarding too many related pairs). In this work, we extend them
    with Supervised Scheduling, a quick and principled way of defining
    the processing order of the candidate geometry pairs that are likely
    to be topologically related, based on their classification probability.
    Our approach leverages generic features with low extraction cost
    but high discriminatory power. We integrate Supervised Scheduling into a progressive end-to-end algorithm that automatically
    labels the required training instances at a low computational cost.
    Thorough experiments verify the high performance and robustness
    of our features as well as the limited size of the training set that suffices for learning an accurate classification model. Our experiments
    also verify the superior performance of our approach in comparison
    to existing learning-free ones over five real, large datasets.},

Geospatial Interlinking aims to cover this gap by associating geometries with topological relations like those of the Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model. Due to its quadratic time complexity, various algorithms aim to carry out Geospatial Interlinking efficiently. We present JedAI-spatial, a novel, open-source system that organizes these algorithms according to three dimensions: (i) Space Tiling, which determines the approach that reduces the search space, (ii) Budget-awareness, which distinguishes interlinking algorithms into batch and progressive ones, and (iii) Execution mode, which discerns between serial algorithms, running on a single CPU-core, and parallel ones, running on top of Apache Spark. We analytically describe JedAI-spatial’s architecture and capabilities and perform thorough experiments to provide interesting insights about the relative performance of its algorithms.},
