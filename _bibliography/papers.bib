  abstract = {Recent progress in geospatial foundation models highlights the importance of learning 
  general-purpose representations for real-world locations, particularly points-of-interest 
  (POIs) where human activity concentrates. Existing approaches, however, 
  focus primarily on place identity derived from static textual metadata, 
  or learn representations tied to trajectory context, which capture movement regularities rather 
  than how places are actually used (i.e., POI's function). We argue that POI function is a missing 
  but essential signal for general POI representations. We introduce Mobility-Embedded POIs (ME-POIs), 
  a framework that augments POI embeddings derived, from language models with large-scale human mobility 
  data to learn POI-centric, context-independent representations grounded in real-world usage. ME-POIs 
  encodes individual visits as temporally contextualized embeddings and aligns them with learnable POI 
  representations via contrastive learning to capture usage patterns across users and time. To address 
  long-tail sparsity, we propose a novel mechanism that propagates temporal visit patterns from nearby, 
  frequently visited POIs across multiple spatial scales. We evaluate ME-POIs on five newly proposed map 
  enrichment tasks, testing its ability to capture both the identity and function of POIs. Across all tasks, 
  augmenting text-based embeddings with ME-POIs consistently outperforms both text-only and mobility-only 
  baselines. Notably, ME-POIs trained on mobility data alone can surpass text-only models on certain tasks, 
  highlighting that POI function is a critical component of accurate and generalizable POI representations.},

  abstract={Recent advances in large foundation models (FMs) have enabled
      learning general-purpose representations in natural language, vi-
      sion, and audio. Yet geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) still
      lacks widely adopted foundation models that generalize across tasks
      that require joint reasoning over geospatial objects and human mo-
      bility. Such tasks are crucial as mobility, along with satellite imagery,
      street view, and text, is a core modality for understanding the phys-
      ical world. We argue that a key bottleneck is the absence of unified,
      general-purpose, and transferable representations for geospatially
      embedded objects (GEOs). Such objects include points, polylines,
      and polygons in geographic space, enriched with semantic context
      and critical for geospatial reasoning. Much current GeoAI research
      compares GEOs to tokens in language models, where patterns of
      human movement and spatiotemporal interactions yield contextual
      meaning similar to patterns of words in text. However, modeling
      GEOs introduces challenges fundamentally different from language,
      including spatial continuity, variable scale and resolution, temporal
      dynamics, and data sparsity. Moreover, privacy constraints and
      global variation in mobility further complicates modeling and gen-
      eralization. This paper formalizes these challenges, identifies key
      representational gaps, and outlines research directions for building
      foundation models that learn behavior-informed, transferable rep-
      resentations of GEOs from large-scale human mobility data, as well
      as static contextual information such as points of interest, object
      shapes and spatio-temporal semantics.},

              as identifying the topological relationships between two different
              geospatial objects. However, existing encoding methods are limited as they are typically customized to handle only specific types
              of spatial data, which impedes their applicability across different
              downstream tasks where multiple data types coexist. To address
              this, we introduce Poly2Vec, an encoding framework that unifies
              the modeling of different geospatial objects, including 2D points,
              polylines, and polygons, irrespective of the downstream task. We
              leverage the power of the 2D Fourier transform to encode useful
              spatial properties, such as shape and location, from geospatial objects into fixed-length vectors. These vectors are then inputted into
              neural network models for spatial reasoning tasks. This unified approach eliminates the need to develop and train separate models for
              each distinct spatial type. We evaluate Poly2Vec on both synthetic
              and real datasets of mixed geometry types and verify its consistent
              performance across several downstream spatial reasoning tasks.},

  abstract = {Accurately modeling and analyzing time series data is crucial for downstream applications across various fields, including healthcare, finance, astronomy, and epidemiology. However, real-world time series often exhibit irregularities such as misaligned timestamps, missing entries, and variable sampling rates, complicating their analysis. Existing approaches often rely on imputation, which can introduce biases. A few approaches that directly model irregularity tend to focus exclusively on either capturing intra-series patterns or inter-series relationships, missing the benefits of integrating both. To this end, we present WaveGNN, a novel framework designed to directly (i.e., no imputation) embed irregularly sampled multivariate time series data for accurate predictions. WaveGNN utilizes a Transformer-based encoder to capture intra-series patterns by directly encoding the temporal dynamics of each time series. To capture inter-series relationships, WaveGNN uses a dynamic graph neural network model, where each node represents a sensor, and the edges capture the long- and short-term relationships between them. Our experimental results on real-world healthcare datasets demonstrate that WaveGNN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, with an average relative improvement of 14.7% in F1-score when compared to the second-best baseline in cases with extreme sparsity. Our ablation studies reveal that both intra-series and inter-series modeling significantly contribute to this notable improvement.},

              compute driving routes between origins and destinations. Current graph-based routing pipelines, 
              while effective, involve substantial costs in constructing, maintaining, and updating road network 
              graphs to reflect real-time conditions. In this study, we propose a new trajectory-based routing 
              paradigm that bypasses current workflows by directly utilizing raw trajectory data to compute 
              efficient routes. Our method, named TrajRoute, uniquely "follows" historical trajectories from 
              a source to a destination, constructing paths that reflect actual driver behavior and implicit 
              preferences. To supplement areas with sparse trajectory data, the road network is also incorporated 
              into TrajRoute's index, and tunable parameters are introduced to control the balance between road 
              segments and trajectories, ensuring a unified and adaptable routing approach. We experimentally verify 
              our approach by comparing it to an existing online routing service. Our results demonstrate that as the 
              number of trajectories covering the road network increases, TrajRoute produces increasingly accurate 
              travel time and route length estimates while gradually eliminating the need to downgrade to the road 
              network. This highlights the potential of simpler, data-driven pipelines for routing, offering 
              lower-maintenance alternatives to conventional systems.},

    applicability of conventional machine-learning (ML) approaches.
    In this study, we analyze full-day motion recordings from two
    groups: typically developing infants (N = 12) and infants at
    risk for developmental disabilities (N = 24), further divided
    into those with good (N = 10) and poor (N = 9) developmental
    outcomes at 24 months. The goal is to differentiate at-risk (AR)
    infants from those with typical development (TD) and predict
    outcomes for the at-risk category using wearable data. Due to its
    limited size, previous studies on this dataset, employing statistical
    and machine learning methods, raise reliability concerns. To
    address this, we introduce a novel algorithmic approach to extract
    meaningful patterns, referred to as Motifs, from the raw signals.
    The abundance of Motifs serves as highly informative indicators,
    enabling effective differentiation between the groups. Evaluation
    on this limited-size dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of
    Motifs in distinguishing AR from TD infants and predicting
    future outcomes for the at-risk category.},

    Progressive methods were recently proposed to reduce this cost by
    sacrificing recall to an affordable extent. They operate in a learningfree manner that relies on mere heuristics, which can be conservative (i.e., retaining too many unrelated pairs) or aggressive (i.e.,
    discarding too many related pairs). In this work, we extend them
    with Supervised Scheduling, a quick and principled way of defining
    the processing order of the candidate geometry pairs that are likely
    to be topologically related, based on their classification probability.
    Our approach leverages generic features with low extraction cost
    but high discriminatory power. We integrate Supervised Scheduling into a progressive end-to-end algorithm that automatically
    labels the required training instances at a low computational cost.
    Thorough experiments verify the high performance and robustness
