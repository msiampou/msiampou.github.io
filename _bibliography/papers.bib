    abstract = "We present an extension of YAGO4, the latest version of the YAGO knowledge graph, with qualitative geospatial information representing the administrative organization of Greece. To achieve this, we derive new geospatial information from the Greek Administrative Geography (GAG) dataset, an official source of the administrative divisions of Greece. Our goal has been to extend entities already existing in YAGO4 with geospatial information and add missing entities without introducing duplicate knowledge. Our study should be viewed as a demonstration of how YAGO4 can be extended with administrative geospatial information for the whole world. In addition, it has allowed us to uncover certain issues that exist with the representation and querying of geospatial information in schema.org and YAGO4 which we discuss in detail.",

    abstract = "Forecasting the number of visits to Points-of-Interest (POI) in an urban area is critical for planning and decision-making for various application domains, from urban planning and transportation management to public health and social studies. Although this forecasting problem can be formulated as a multivariate time-series forecasting task, the current approaches cannot fully exploit the ever-changing multi-context correlations among POIs. Therefore, we propose Busyness Graph Neural Network (BysGNN), a temporal graph neural network designed to learn and uncover the underlying multi-context correlations between POIs for accurate visit forecasting. Unlike other approaches where only time-series data is used to learn a dynamic graph, BysGNN utilizes all contextual information and time-series data to learn an accurate dynamic graph representation. By incorporating all contextual, temporal, and spatial signals, we observe a significant improvement in our forecasting accuracy over state-of-the-art forecasting models in our experiments with real-world datasets across the United States.",

    abstract = "Geospatial data constitutes a considerable part of (Semantic) Web data, but so far, its sources are inadequately interlinked in the Linked Open Data cloud. Geospatial Interlinking aims to cover this gap by associating geometries with topological relations like those of the Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model. Due to its quadratic time complexity, various algorithms aim to carry out Geospatial Interlinking efficiently. We present JedAI-spatial, a novel, open-source system that organizes these algorithms according to three dimensions: (i) Space Tiling, which determines the approach that reduces the search space, (ii) Budget-awareness, which distinguishes interlinking algorithms into batch and progressive ones, and (iii) Execution mode, which discerns between serial algorithms, running on a single CPU-core, and parallel ones, running on top of Apache Spark. We analytically describe JedAI-spatial's architecture and capabilities and perform thorough experiments to provide interesting insights about the relative performance of its algorithms.",
