  abstract={The Wearables for Health Toolkit (W4H Toolkit)
    is an open-source platform that provides a robust, end-to-end
    solution for the centralized management and analysis of wearable
    data. With integrated tools and frameworks, the toolkit facilitates
    seamless data acquisition, integration, storage, analysis, and
    visualization of both stored and streaming data from various
    wearable devices. The W4H Toolkit is designed to provide
    medical researchers and health practitioners with a unified
    framework that enables the analysis of health-related data for
    various clinical applications. We provide an overview of the
    system and demonstrate how it can be used by health researchers
    to import and analyze a wide range of wearable data and perform
    data analysis, highlighting the versatility and functionality of the

  abstract={The inherent challenges in recruiting human subjects, particularly infants, often hinder the acquisition of sufficiently large datasets for health research, thereby limiting the
    applicability of conventional machine-learning (ML) approaches.
    In this study, we analyze full-day motion recordings from two
    groups: typically developing infants (N = 12) and infants at
    risk for developmental disabilities (N = 24), further divided
    into those with good (N = 10) and poor (N = 9) developmental
    outcomes at 24 months. The goal is to differentiate at-risk (AR)
    infants from those with typical development (TD) and predict
    outcomes for the at-risk category using wearable data. Due to its
    limited size, previous studies on this dataset, employing statistical
    and machine learning methods, raise reliability concerns. To
    address this, we introduce a novel algorithmic approach to extract
    meaningful patterns, referred to as Motifs, from the raw signals.
    The abundance of Motifs serves as highly informative indicators,
    enabling effective differentiation between the groups. Evaluation
    on this limited-size dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of
    Motifs in distinguishing AR from TD infants and predicting
    future outcomes for the at-risk category.},

  abstract={Forecasting the number of visits to Points-of-Interest (POI) in an
    urban area is critical for planning and decision making in various application domains, from urban planning and transportation
    management to public health and social studies. Although this forecasting problem can be formulated as a multivariate time-series
    forecasting task, current approaches cannot fully exploit the everchanging multi-context correlations among POIs. Therefore, we
    propose Busyness Graph Neural Network (BysGNN), a temporal
    graph neural network designed to learn and uncover the underlying
    multi-context correlations between POIs for accurate visit forecasting. Unlike other approaches where only time-series data is used to
    learn a dynamic graph, BysGNN utilizes all contextual information
    and time-series data to learn an accurate dynamic graph representation. By incorporating all contextual, temporal, and spatial signals,
    we observe a significant improvement in our forecasting accuracy
    over state-of-the-art forecasting models in our experiments with
    real-world datasets across the United States.}

  abstract={Geospatial Interlinking constitutes a crucial data integration task
    that associates pairs of geometries with topological relations. Its
    high computational cost, though, scales poorly to voluminous datasets.
    Progressive methods were recently proposed to reduce this cost by
    sacrificing recall to an affordable extent. They operate in a learningfree manner that relies on mere heuristics, which can be conservative (i.e., retaining too many unrelated pairs) or aggressive (i.e.,
    discarding too many related pairs). In this work, we extend them
    with Supervised Scheduling, a quick and principled way of defining
    the processing order of the candidate geometry pairs that are likely
    to be topologically related, based on their classification probability.
    Our approach leverages generic features with low extraction cost
    but high discriminatory power. We integrate Supervised Scheduling into a progressive end-to-end algorithm that automatically
    labels the required training instances at a low computational cost.
    Thorough experiments verify the high performance and robustness
    of our features as well as the limited size of the training set that suffices for learning an accurate classification model. Our experiments
    also verify the superior performance of our approach in comparison
    to existing learning-free ones over five real, large datasets.}

    geospatial information representing the administrative organization of Greece. To achieve this, we
    derive new geospatial information from the Greek Administrative Geography (GAG) dataset, an official
    source of the administrative divisions of Greece. Our goal has been to extend entities already existing in
    YAGO4 with geospatial information and add missing entities without introducing duplicate knowledge.
    Our study should be viewed as a demonstration of how YAGO4 can be extended with administrative
    geospatial information for the whole world. In addition, it has allowed us to uncover certain issues that
    exist with the representation and querying of geospatial information in schema.org and YAGO4 which
    we discuss in detail.}

  abstract={Geospatial data constitutes a considerable part of Semantic Web data, but so far, its sources are inadequately interlinked in the Linked Open Data cloud. Geospatial Interlinking aims to cover this gap by associating geometries with topological relations like those of the Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model. Due to its quadratic time complexity, various algorithms aim to carry out Geospatial Interlinking efficiently. We present JedAI-spatial, a novel, open-source system that organizes these algorithms according to three dimensions: (i) Space Tiling, which determines the approach that reduces the search space, (ii) Budget-awareness, which distinguishes interlinking algorithms into batch and progressive ones, and (iii) Execution mode, which discerns between serial algorithms, running on a single CPU-core, and parallel ones, running on top of Apache Spark. We analytically describe JedAI-spatialâ€™s architecture and capabilities and perform thorough experiments to provide interesting insights about the relative performance of its algorithms.},
