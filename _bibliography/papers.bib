    abstract = "Multilingual machine translation suffers from negative interference across languages. A common solution is to relax parameter sharing with language-specific modules like adapters. However, adapters of related languages are unable to transfer information, and their total number of parameters becomes prohibitively expensive as the number of languages grows. In this work, we overcome these drawbacks using hyper-adapters -- hyper-networks that generate adapters from language and layer embeddings. While past work had poor results when scaling hyper-networks, we propose a rescaling fix that significantly improves convergence and enables training larger hyper-networks. We find that hyper-adapters are more parameter efficient than regular adapters, reaching the same performance with up to 12 times less parameters. When using the same number of parameters and FLOPS, our approach consistently outperforms regular adapters. Also, hyper-adapters converge faster than alternative approaches and scale better than regular dense networks. Our analysis shows that hyper-adapters learn to encode language relatedness, enabling positive transfer across languages.",

    abstract = Geospatial data constitutes a considerable part of (Semantic) Web data, but so far, its sources are inadequately interlinked in the Linked Open Data cloud. Geospatial Interlinking aims to cover this gap by associating geometries with topological relations like those of the Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model. Due to its quadratic time complexity, various algorithms aim to carry out Geospatial Interlinking efficiently. We present JedAI-spatial, a novel, open-source system that organizes these algorithms according to three dimensions: (i) Space Tiling, which determines the approach that reduces the search space, (ii) Budget-awareness, which distinguishes interlinking algorithms into batch and progressive ones, and (iii) Execution mode, which discerns between serial algorithms, running on a single CPU-core, and parallel ones, running on top of Apache Spark. We analytically describe JedAI-spatial's architecture and capabilities and perform thorough experiments to provide interesting insights about the relative performance of its algorithms.",
