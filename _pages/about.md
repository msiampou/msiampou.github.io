Hi! My name is Maria. :wave:

I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at University of Southern California advised by Prof. [Cyrus Shahabi](https://infolab.usc.edu/Shahabi/index.html). My research interests include the management and analysis of spatial and temporal data types.

Prior to USC, I received my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science at National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. During that time, I used to work on interlinking pipelines of geospatial data on the Semantic Web with Prof. [Manolis Koubarakis](https://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~koubarak/).
