I am a 4th-year PhD student in Computer Science at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) (USC✌️), advised by Prof. [Cyrus Shahabi](https://infolab.usc.edu/Shahabi/index.html).

My research focuses on **geospatial foundation models**, with an emphasis on modeling **geo-vector data** (e.g., points, polylines, polygons) and **mobility trajectories** to create general-purpose spatial representations. I also, collaborate closely with SpaceTime Team @ Google Research on this effort, contributing to their broader initiative on [Geospatial Reasoning](https://research.google/blog/geospatial-reasoning-unlocking-insights-with-generative-ai-and-multiple-foundation-models/).

Prior to USC, I received my Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Computer Science at National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece. During that time, I worked on interlinking pipelines of geospatial data on the Semantic Web, advised by Prof. [Manolis Koubarakis](https://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~koubarak/). I also interned as a Software Development Engineer on [Amazon Redshift Database](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/redshift/?gclid=CjwKCAiAudG5BhAREiwAWMlSjKXHfQFaRFcxBlGDVQPTzEI605CsjDNMrTLUA2cYb86-ak6ajGBhyBoCDIIQAvD_BwE&trk=765e8455-cae6-4207-a6bc-c454bfc2c9d8&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=CjwKCAiAudG5BhAREiwAWMlSjKXHfQFaRFcxBlGDVQPTzEI605CsjDNMrTLUA2cYb86-ak6ajGBhyBoCDIIQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!651751058820!p!!g!!redshift%20business%20intelligence!19852662155!145019244657) in Berlin, Germany, where I worked on the implementation of [spatial window functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/geospatial-functions.html) for geospatial analytics.
