I am a 3rd-year PhD student in Computer Science at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) (USC✌️), advised by Prof. [Cyrus Shahabi](https://infolab.usc.edu/Shahabi/index.html).

Broadly speaking, my research interests include the management and analysis of spatial and spatio-temporal data types. Lately, my work focuses on the encoding techniques of geospatial objects in order to enable spatial reasoning tasks.

I received my Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Computer Science at National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece. During that time, I used to work on interlinking pipelines of geospatial data on the Semantic Web, advised by Prof. [Manolis Koubarakis](https://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~koubarak/). During my Master’s I’ve also interned as a Software Developement Engineer at [Amazon Redshift Database](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/redshift/?gclid=CjwKCAiAudG5BhAREiwAWMlSjKXHfQFaRFcxBlGDVQPTzEI605CsjDNMrTLUA2cYb86-ak6ajGBhyBoCDIIQAvD_BwE&trk=765e8455-cae6-4207-a6bc-c454bfc2c9d8&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=CjwKCAiAudG5BhAREiwAWMlSjKXHfQFaRFcxBlGDVQPTzEI605CsjDNMrTLUA2cYb86-ak6ajGBhyBoCDIIQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!651751058820!p!!g!!redshift%20business%20intelligence!19852662155!145019244657) (Spatial Team) in Berlin, Germany.
