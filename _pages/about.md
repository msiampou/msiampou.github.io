Hi! :wave: My name is Maria.

I am a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at University of Southern California advised by Prof. [Cyrus Shahabi](https://infolab.usc.edu/Shahabi/index.html). Broadly speaking, my research interests include the management and analysis of time series and spatial data.

Prior to USC, I received my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science at National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece. During that time, I used to work on interlinking pipelines of geospatial data on the Semantic Web, advised by Prof. [Manolis Koubarakis](https://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~koubarak/).

During my Master's I've also interned as a Software Developement Engineer at [Amazon Redshift Database (Spatial Team)](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/redshift/?trk=8e5f044b-6475-484a-b7eb-8923cfdd5362&sc_channel=ps&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!524552148442!e!!g!!amazon%20redshift&ef_id=Cj0KCQiAj4ecBhD3ARIsAM4Q_jHF2BEjT19GlAV0qHyEfaO9fSRL-67lPWf8ngdCdX3wX4w5tMqx3DgaApWLEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!524552148442!e!!g!!amazon%20redshift) in Berlin, Germany. 

You can find my CV [here](/files/siampou_cv.pdf)!
